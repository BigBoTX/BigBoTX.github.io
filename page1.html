    <h1>The Present of The Houston Texans</h1>

    <p>
        The offseason leading into the 2023 NFL season was full of uncertiany and excitment. This was due to the massive new talent aquisitions and Head Coach, Demeco Ryans. With his expertise and past successes The Houston Texans are very excited to have a new Head Coach who knows what a winning formula takes. One main Component Ryans has prioritized has been the additions of new and improved talent within the team, and this was evident within the Free Agent Market and NFL Draft. A various number of key additions were made this Free Agency Period, but the Houston Texans' NFL draft was where absolutely franchise altering choices were made. 
      </p>
  
      <p>A blockbuster trade to aquire not only one bluechip player, but two. CJ Stroud, QB from Ohio State and Will Anderson, Defensive End from Alabama were the 2nd and 3rd overall selecctions, both made by The Houston Texans. These two rookies have been nothing short of amazing this year, especially CJ Stroud as he is looking at the greatest rookie Quarterback season ever, a massive and amazing fact. CJ's maturity and talent is well beyond his years and he has cemented himself as one of the best Quarterbacks within the NFL. Will Anderson on the other hand, has appeared as much more of project type of player. His talent and impact displays pure promise and dominance, however his transition to the NFL has been dissapointing at times, due to the lack of production. Regardless of the lack of production, the potential is remarkable.</p>
  
      <p>These changes within the franchise have made the fanbase beyond elated and excited for the future, as currently the Texans sit at a record of 5-3, with almost double the wins midway through the season as many Houston has throughout the entire season in 2022. This had brought immense hope and promise all throughout Houston as it looks that The Texans will turn into a dominant and powerful team.</p>
